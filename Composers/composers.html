        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Nobuo Uematsu</h2>
        <p class="lead">Nobuo Uematsu (born March 21, 1959) is a Japanese composer and keyboardist best 
          known for his contributions to the Final Fantasy video game series by Square Enix. A self-taught 
          musician, he began playing the piano at the age of twelve, with English singer-songwriter Elton 
          John as one of his biggest influences. Uematsu joined Square in 1986, where he first met Final 
          Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The two later worked together on many games at the company, 
          most notably in the Final Fantasy series. After nearly two decades with Square, Uematsu left in 2004 
          to create his own production company and music label, Dog Ear Records. He has since composed music 
          as a freelancer for other games, including ones developed by Square Enix and Sakaguchi's development 
          studio, Mistwalker. Many soundtracks and arranged albums of Uematsu's game scores have been 
          released. Pieces from his video game works have been performed in various Final Fantasy 
          concerts, where he has worked with Grammy Award–winning conductor Arnie Roth on several of 
          these performances. In the 2000s, he was the keyboardist in the hard rock band The Black Mages, 
          along with Square Enix colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito. The band played various 
          arranged rock versions of Uematsu's Final Fantasy compositions. He has since performed with 
          Earthbound Papas, which he formed as the successor to The Black Mages in 2011. He is sometimes 
          referred to as the Beethoven of video game music and has made several appearances in the annual 
          Classic FM Hall of Fame.</p>
