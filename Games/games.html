        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Yakuza: Like A Dragon (2020)</h2>
        <p class="lead">Yakuza: Like a Dragon is a role-playing video game (RPG) developed and published 
            by Sega. There were many artists in charge of the OST for this game, but two of them stand out
            because of hte number of tracks they composed: <strong>Hidenori Shoji</strong> and 
            <strong>Chihiro Aoki</strong>. In contrast to previous Yakuza games that focused on the life of Kazuma Kiryu, 
            a man trying to lead a normal life following his retirement from the Tojo Clan, this game 
            instead introduces a new protagonist named Ichiban Kasuga. After being imprisoned for 18 years 
            only to then be betrayed by his former boss, Ichiban goes on a personal quest to become a hero 
            and uncover the reason for his betrayal alongside other playable characters. Like a Dragon 
            received positive reviews from both players and critics who enjoyed the narrative, characters, 
            gameplay, unique take on the JRPG sub-genre, and presentation.</p>
